# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.

  
## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
    I thought python would be weird, as I previously spent a long time in java learning all of the ways to write programs so python felt weird as it was an interpreter language.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
    Java is not an interpreter language so you have to define variables for what they are while python is an interpreter language where you just assign values to variables without defining what the variable will be.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
    I learned how to make variables, how to write functions, and how to look up built in funtions for python to utilize in my programs.
